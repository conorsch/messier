Test Ansible roles with Vagrant. Inspired by Test Kitchen.

* Free software: ISC license
* Documentation: https://messier.readthedocs.org.

Features
--------

* Supports multi-machine roles
* Permits reboots during provisioning
* Use any backend provider available in Vagrant (VirtualBox, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
* Runs Serverspec tests per role
* Integrates with preexisting Serverspec setups

Motivation
----------

Test Kitchen is a wonderful solution for testing system configurationâ€”if you use Chef.
Its support for Ansible is, however, lacking. Similar to Packer, Test Kitchen tries
to run Ansible in "local" mode, which makes it impossible to test multi-machine roles
for service orchestration. Well-meaning projects such as kitchen-ansiblepush (not to
be mistaken with Ansible push mode) enable more traditional Ansible usage patterns,
but still suffer from limitations such as reboots always triggering failure.
